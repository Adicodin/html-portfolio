<h1>The Best Movies According to Aditi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Mission Mangal</h3>
<p>This movie is about the space mission of ISRO to land the rover on mars and India did this in one go with the budget of only 400 crores. 
It is a very inspiring movie.
</p>
<h3>Fashion</h3>
<p>This is a movie by Madhur Bhandarkar who is one of my favourite directors. It is a highly realistic and practical movie. It describes the struggle of a model from achieving early success to her downfall and comback.</p>
<h3>MS Dhoni - The Untold Story</h3>
<p>This is another phenomenal movie which is a biopic of the famous Indian Cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni. The lead role is played by Sushant Singh Rajput who has done a very impactiful acting. The movie is very realistic and highlights the failures of his journey as well which is the best part as per me.</p>
